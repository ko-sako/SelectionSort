# Selection Sort Visualization

This project provides a visual representation of the **Selection Sort** algorithm using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The visualization helps users understand how Selection Sort works by animating the sorting process of a randomly generated array of integers.

## Features

- Visualizes the Selection Sort algorithm step-by-step.
- Generates a random integer array for sorting.
- Highlights the current comparison value during each iteration.
- Provides a user-friendly interface to start the sorting process.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ko-sako/SelectionSort.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   '''bash
   cd SelectionSort 
3. Open index.html in your web browser to view the application.

## Usage
1. Click the **Start Sorting** button to begin the sorting process.
2. Observe the animation as the algorithm compares and swaps value into the correct position.

## How It Works
- The algorithm generates a random array of integers within the range of 10 to 109.
- The **Selection Sort** algorithm works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element.
- Each step of the sorting process is visually represented by highlithing.

## Code Structure
- index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the page.
- styles.css: The CSS file for styling the array.
- script.js: The JavaScript file that implements the sorting algorithm and handles the visualization.
